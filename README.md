# 🧠 The Paradox of AI Learning  
### Why Students Using AI Are Losing the Skills They Need Most in the AI Era

This repository hosts the published version of my independent analytical report:  
**“The Paradox of AI Learning: Responsible and Balanced Integration of Generative AI in Education.”**

The work explores a growing contradiction in modern education — as students increasingly rely on generative AI for assignments, learning efficiency improves, but genuine reasoning, creativity, and problem-solving begin to decline.  
The analysis investigates how overdependence on AI affects cognitive growth and proposes a balanced framework for responsible use.

## 📘 Overview

The report identifies the *paradox of AI learning* — that tools designed to enhance human intellect may quietly erode it through automation of thought.  
It discusses:
- How generative AI reshapes study habits and academic integrity  
- The psychological and cognitive risks of digital overreliance  
- The decline of analytical and creative reasoning in AI-rich environments  
- The importance of AI literacy and critical prompting as cognitive safeguards  

It concludes by proposing an **AI Literacy Framework** focused on balance, critical engagement, and ethical use of intelligent systems in education.
